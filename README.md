## Why I find it interesting
I find this article interesting because it compares job searching in software engineering to dating, showing that rejection often happens due to mismatched expectations rather than lack of skill. This perspective makes the hiring process feel more understandable and encourages a more patient and realistic approach to career development.

By comparing the search to dating, it highlights that a "no" is often just a sign of mismatched expectations—culture, specific tech stack needs, or team dynamics—rather than a lack of talent. This shift in mindset is crucial for developers; it transforms the job hunt from a discouraging series of "failures" into a strategic search for the right partnership. It encourages us to focus on long-term career growth and patience over the frustration of a single rejection.
